<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been captivated by the intricate interconnections that pervade diverse domains. My deep-seated passion for mathematics unveils these ties, making them more pronounced. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Finance, with a specialization in Real Estate, at Syracuse University. This academic path has not only sharpened my theoretical grasp but has also been an avenue for practical application. My internship at Wells Fargo's Corporate Properties Group provided me invaluable experience in the realm of corporate real estate, bridging the gap between theory and real-world business challenges.</p>

    <p>Moreover, my commitment to education extends beyond personal growth. I take immense pride in tutoring students from the Martin J. Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University during the academic semester. As I seek new opportunities, my aim is to continuously learn, foster meaningful relationships, and drive positive change within my community and beyond.</p>
